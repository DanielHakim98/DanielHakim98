- My strongest language would be Python (Python is love!!!)
- Current tech stack used at work, Golang, TypeScript, React.js, and Postgres/PostGIS
- Working on backend of mapping solution WebApp somewhere around Malaysia.

That's it. Nothing more. Oh some of topics that I'm currently exploring are:
- Computer Architecture
- Networking
- Fundamental Principle of Programming.
